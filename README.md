# Coseismic-Slip-Distribution-Inversion

This contains the Jupyter Notebook used to carry out the kinematic coseismic slip distribution inversion for the Mutatá earthquake described in the article at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2022.103728.

This Notebook uses the routines of ObsPy for some data pre-processing and MudPy for the inversion. Some of the metadata (e.g., velocity model, response files, aftershock locations etc) and seismological data (regional and global) are also provided. Check the Matlab and gmt files for some file formatting and plotting.
