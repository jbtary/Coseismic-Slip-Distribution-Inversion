# Coseismic-Slip-Distribution-Inversion

This contains the Jupyter Notebook used to carry out the kinematic coseismic slip distribution inversion for the Mutat치 earthquake described in the article at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2022.103728.

This Notebook uses the routines of ObsPy for some data pre-processing and MudPy for the inversion (written using Python 2). The Notebook explains how to download them at the beginning. Some of the metadata (e.g., velocity model, response files, aftershock locations etc) and seismological data (regional and global) are also provided. Check the Matlab and gmt files for some file formatting and plotting.

The regional seismological data file being too large to upload to GitHub (2016-09-14-0151-59M.COL___318), you can look at the catalog on the Servicio Geol칩gico Colombiano webpage to download it: http://bdrsnc.sgc.gov.co/paginas1/catalogo/index.php.
