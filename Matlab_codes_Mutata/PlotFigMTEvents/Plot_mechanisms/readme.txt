Program PLOT_MECHANISMS.m 
=========================

description: Program plots non-double-couple mechanisms from full seismic moment tensors 
             in the lower-hemisphere equal are projection. Shadow area denotes directions 
             of positive P-wave polarities.

name of the program: plot_mechanisms.m         

auxilary functions: P_T_axes_.m, nodal_lines_.m, angles.m, shadowing.m 

input:  moments.dat
